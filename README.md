# Geometrically Consistent Partial-to-Partial Shape Matching

## Code 
The code for the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/vikiehm/gcppsm).

## CUTS'24
During this work we have observed that the original SHREC16 CUTS test split contains 47 shapes that are almost identical (up to some slight vertex jitter) to shapes in the original training set (see supplementary material for details). Thus, we consider only the remaining 153 shapes of the original test set. These 153 shapes can be found under the CUTS'24 folder.
